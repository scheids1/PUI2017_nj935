**CLARITY**: *****is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?*****

The font and text size of all text are easy to read. The plot has a title and caption. The quantities are percentages with 
one decimal point, which is easy to understand. 

One confusing aspect is that the types of cuisine included change per season. For instance, the Winter plot has "Hamburgers", 
which none of the other plots has. 

Additionally, it is not clear exactly what the percent is. I imagine there are more cuisine types, so this cannot be the percent of total violations. Is it the top 8 cuisine types per season? 


**ESTHETIC**: *****beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is 
"beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors 
chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? 
Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?*****

The colors as they correspond to cuisine type changes throghout the four plots. For example, in the Spring plot, 
"American" is orange, but in the other three plots, it is blue. 

Each pie chart is easy to read on its own, but when plotted together, it is overwhelming and difficult to compare across all 
four. I think a bar plot might be a better option, which I think would make it easier to compare both season 



**HONESTY**: *****is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?*****

Without being overly familiar with the underlaying data, the plot does not seem to be manipulating the data. 

However, I would be curious to know how often inspections are done. For instance, perhaps it just so happens that signficantly more American restaurants are inspected during summer, and thus account for more of the violations. 


**IMPROVEMENTS TO EACH PLOT**

Improvements could be made by rectifying the issues outlined above (making data clearer, consistent colors, same cuisine types, etc)
