**CLARITY**: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?

The font and text size of all text are easy to read. The plot has a title and caption. The quantities are percentages with 
one decimal point, which is easy to understand. 

One confusing aspect is that the types of cuisine included change per season. For instance, the Winter plot has "Hamburgers", 
which none of the other plots has. 


**ESTHETIC**: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is 
"beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors 
chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? 
Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

The colors as they correspond to cuisine type changes throghout the four plots. For example, in the Spring plot, 
"American" is orange, but in the other three plots, it is blue. 


**HONESTY**: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?

Without being overly familiar with the underlaying data, the plot does not seem to be manipulating the data. 


**IMPROVEMENTS TO EACH PLOT**

Improvements could be made by rectifying the issues outlined above (consistent colors, same cuisine types, etc) 

I would like to see these four plots at bar charts, which I think could make it easier to compare across seasons and/or cuisine types.
